# 🤝 Contributing to A2A Protocol Demo Suite

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project demonstrates cutting-edge agent communication patterns and serves as an educational resource for the community.

## 🎯 Types of Contributions

We welcome:
- 🐛 **Bug fixes** - Improve existing functionality
- ✨ **Feature enhancements** - New demos, protocols, or capabilities
- 📚 **Documentation** - Better guides, examples, or explanations
- 🎨 **UI/UX improvements** - Better user experience
- 🔧 **Code quality** - Refactoring, optimization, testing
- 🌐 **Protocol implementations** - Additional agent communication patterns

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/A2A.git
cd A2A

# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Setup environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-a2a.txt

# Test that everything works
python start_complete_demo.py
```

### 2. Development Guidelines

#### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use meaningful variable names
- **JavaScript**: Use modern ES6+, consistent indentation
- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic markup, responsive design
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic, protocol interactions

#### Project Structure
```
A2A/
├── frontend/          # Web demos - keep lightweight
├── backend/           # Protocol implementation - modular design
├── scripts/           # Utility scripts - clear naming
├── docs/             # Documentation - comprehensive guides
└── examples/         # Integration examples - real-world use cases
```

#### Protocol Accuracy
- **A2A Protocol**: Must follow Google's specification
- **MCP Integration**: Maintain authentic protocol patterns
- **Educational Value**: Code should teach, not just work

### 3. Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Test all demos work
python start_complete_demo.py
# Open http://localhost:3000 and test each demo

# Test frontend-only mode
cd frontend && python -m http.server 3000
# Verify graceful fallbacks work

# Test individual services
python start_registry.py        # Port 8000
python start_orchestrator.py    # Port 8001
python start_payment_agent.py   # Port 8002
# etc.
```
